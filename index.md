The slides presented can be found [here](Introduction_to_Pathway_Modeling_and_Analysis.pdf).

## Pathway Drawing
A quick way to get started with pathway drawing is to go through the steps of the [WikiPathways Academy](https://wikipathways.github.io/academy/).

If you are interested in some hands-on pathway drawing, you can choose to draw the pathway in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16eDWmcveBt8FP6WZVlr0E--I2jL1TH3obOr9dZ10o1I/edit). You can also add a pathway you think others may be interested to draw, or you can simply draw your own. The instructors will be present in the Zoom session to help.

## Pathway Analysis
If you want to use pathway models for analysis, [this tutorial](Pathway-analysis.md) will help you get started.
